# Deployment

<DeployButtons enabled="vercel,netlify,railway" />

Those buttons are actually a nifty custom component! [**Scroll down for info 👇🏼**](#deploybuttons-component)

### Static Hosting

Pre-render the website to be deployed on any static hosting:

```sh
npm run generate
```

The `dist/` directory is ready to be deployed (symlink to `.output/public`), [learn more on Nuxt docs](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/deploy/static-hosting).

### Node server

Build the application for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Start the server in production:

```bash
node .output/server/index.mjs
```

Learn more on [Nuxt docs](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/deploy/node-server) for more information.

## DeployButtons Component

The deployment buttons at the top of this page and on the homepage are a custom component, known as — you guessed it — `DeployButtons`. It's exposed as an auto-imported component and is accessible via `<DeployButtons />`, `<deploy-buttons />`, or `:deploy-buttons`.

You can use this **directly in your Markdown** thanks to **MDC**, in any of those three syntaxes.

:::div{.no-numbers}

```vue [kebab]
<deploy-buttons enabled="netlify,vercel" repository="https://github.com/org/repo" />
```

```mdc [mdc]
:deploy-buttons{enabled="vercel,railway,netlify"}
```

:::

It has two optional props:

::div{.leading-8}

- `enabled`{.!font-bold} · comma separated *lowercase** names of providers to render as buttons. Currently supported are **cloudflare**, **github**, **netlify**, **railway**, **render**, and **vercel**.
- `repository` · the repository URL added to each of the rendered buttons
