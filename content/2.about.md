## Icon(ify) Component

You can use **any** icon from the [**Iconify Project**](https://iconify.design) with the included `<Icon />` component.

What's this mean? Access to **100,000** icons in  **100** collections!  [See iconify.design for info -â€º](https://iconify.design){.underline .font-medium}

::alert{type="success"}
The `Icon` component is ready-to-use, without the need for importing it, in either `MDC` format or in the standard Vue syntax.
::

### Examples

Here's a simple example of how to render the BMW logo from the [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org) collection.

::code-group
  ```html [vue]
  <Icon name="simple-icons:bmw" />
  ```
  ```md [mdc]
  :icon{name="simple-icons:bmw"}
  ```
  ::code-block{label="Preview"}
    :icon{name="simple-icons:bmw"}

## Shiki Code Highlighting

It supports code highlighting with Shiki and as well as different [VSCode themes](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/themes.md#all-themes). Updating the theme is as simple as editing your `nuxt.config.[js|ts]`! Learn more in the [Content Code Highlight section](https://content.nuxtjs.org/api/configuration#highlight).

```ts
import { defineNuxtConfig } from 'nuxt'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  content: {
    highlight: {
      theme: 'one-dark-pro',
    }
  }
})
```

### Nested Code Blocks

Markdown has a not-so-well-known feature for syntax highlighting, allowing us to render a fenced code-block inside of... ***a fenced code-block***. This is quite useful for development tutorials, allowing you to display fenced code blocks without using any complicated escape sequences or backslashes.


::code-group

````mdx [Preview]
```ts
export default () => 'Hello Content Wind'
```
````

`````mdx [Source Code]
````md
  ```ts
  export default () => 'Hello Content Wind'
  ```
````
`````
